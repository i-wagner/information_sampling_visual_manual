%% Calculation of dwell times
% Depending on the experimental condition, we either do or do not consider
% fixations on targets, when calculating dwell times. #
% We have four conditions: single-target visual, double-target visual,
% single-target manual, double-target manual
anal.dwellTimes.useTargets = [false, true, false, true];

%% Event detection
% We expect five events to happen in each trial of both, the visual and
% manual search experiment:
% - trial begin
% - start recording
% - fixation cross onset
% - onset of stimuli
% - offset of stimuli (i.e., response)
% 
% For manual search the first two events are coded as NaN, because they did
% not exist in the experiment. Additionally, the "fixation cross onset"
% event is coded as zero, and serves as a reference point, relative to
% which all other event timestamps are calculated
%
% In manual search, we have NO sample numbers, instead, we only have access
% to the timestamps of events

%% Subject exclusion
% Subject 7
% Jan flagged a lot of "bad trials" in the double-target condition of the 
% manual search experiment for this one, i.e., trials where, presumably, 
% pen-dragging occured
% 
% Subject 10
% This one had a lot of fixations on the background, which happened
% especially in the upper screen half. This indicates that this subject had
% problems uncovering stimuli via gaze, so we are not sure whether we can
% properly interpret it's data
% 
% Subject 19
% This one peformed very poorly in the double-target condition of the
% eye tracking experiment (having a negative final score), while also
% having a comparetively large number of excluded trials in this
% condition.
% 
% Subject 20
% This one had problems during eye tracking calibration (reported by HiWi), 
% so we only have data for the manual search condition.
